This is a simple repository of the different tasks accomplished and viewed throughout my CEBD1160 course at Concordia University.
=============================================================
Folders were created through a docker container on my local machine.Hence, "from laptop" note.

GNUPLOT histrograms and scatterplot were created in gnuplot through the command line.Please note, I did not set a terminal or output setting in the command line as to have visualizations open in a new window immediately after code entry.

QB.csv file ( Source of analysis) was stored in same directory as the gnuplot.exe file on local machine.

R histograms and scatterplot were produced through R Studio accessed by running the following command in PowerShell
"docker run -t -p 80:80 -p 8004:8004 opencpu/rstudio" then entering "http://localhost/rstudio" in browser and 
when prompted for username/password:  enter "opencpu"
